# [Quarter 2/4 of 2023] April - June 2023
April is the first month of working at Sak Siam site, which is nicknamed (by P'Roof) as LeSS Uttaradit. Everything used in working at this site is something I have to learn "from scratch." This quarter is therefore a big challenge for me.

👉🏻 Understand LeSS working methodology
👉🏻 Learn about Sak Siam projects
👉🏻 Understand the flow of Sak Siam's web and app
👉🏻 Various APIs
